## Summary
In this capstone, I predicted if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore determining if the first stage will land and the cost of launch can help to determine if an alternate company may want to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch. In this lab, I completed several stesp:
- I collected data from an API and wrangled it into the right format
- I gathered additional supplemental data via webscraping
- I utilized a SQL database and Python/Juptyer Notebooks to perform EDA.
- I created a number of useful visualizations
- I employed Folium as a way to visualize launch sites and landmarks
- I created a dashboard with Dash and Plotly for stakeholder use
- I set up ML models to predict launch success and performed some feature engineering as well
- I created a written report summarizing our findings and recommendations.
